# CodeClub2016-17Game
#### Basic Information
This was a game I made for the 2016-2017 school year for Code Club over the course of approximately 1 month. It was made in Unity 5.X.X using primarily C#. Basic objects were used to create the objects in the game (cubes, cylinders, etc.). 

#### Installing/Playing
In order to play the game on OS X, download the RandomMaze.app file, unzip it if necessary, and run it. To play on Windows or Linux, download the entire repository, open it in Unity, and use the build option to create a version for your desired OS. The game does not currently have support for mobile platforms as it does not have touch controls enabled.
